# Weather Dashboard

## Description

A responsive Weather Dashboard that displays the weather with a 5-day forecast anywhere in the world when a city is searched.  This app utilizes the Open Weather API, which provides temp, wind, humidity, and UV data. A history of the places searched is saved in local storage and displayed to be clicked and viewed again if needed.  Thereâ€™s a delete history button to remove previous searches.  This app is mobile-friendly.
